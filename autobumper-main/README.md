# Autobumper

## Overview

A tiny app that bumps your Discord server written in Go.

Autobumper uses [discoself](https://github.com/krishnassh/discoself), which interacts with the Discord client API in ways that are outside Discord’s official bot platform. Use of selfbots may violate Discord’s Terms of Service. The author is not responsible for any misuse of this project or any consequences that may arise from its use.

## How it works

Once connected, the client sends the Disboard `/bump` slash command and then repeats it at random intervals between **2 hours and 2.5 hours** to reduce predictable behavior.

It matches the command by both:

* Command name
* Disboard application ID: `302050872383242240`

This ensures it does not accidentally trigger another bot’s `bump` command if multiple bots are present in the server.

## Getting required arguments

You must enable **Developer Mode** in Discord to copy IDs.

Go to:
`Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode -> Enable`

Then:

* **Guild ID:** Right-click your server icon -> Copy Server ID
* **Channel ID:** Right-click the channel -> Copy Channel ID
* **User Token:** Refer to the token retrieval guide [here](https://gist.github.com/KrishnaSSH/b518ec90cd54f33d70a7d4525e9258a2).
